      <ul>
        <li>The game has 2 players, playing in rounds.</li>
        <li>
          In each turn, a player rolls two dice as many times as he whishes.
          Each result get added to his CURRENT score.
        </li>
        <li>
          BUT, if the player rolls a 1 on any of the dice, all his CURRENT score
          gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn.
        </li>
        <li>
          The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his CURRENT score
          gets added to his GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next player's
          turn.
        </li>
        <li>
          A player looses his ENTIRE score when he rolls two 6 in a row on any
          of the dice. After that, it's the next player's turn.
        </li>
        <li>
          The first player to reach Winner score entered by user on GLOBAL score
          wins the game.
